# PlanRepairKR21
This program is created by Simona Ondrčková and it’s an implementation of the algorithm presented by Barták et al. at the KR 2021 Conference (https://proceedings.kr.org/2021/10/kr2021-0010-bartak-et-al.pdf). The program focuses on plan correction in Hierarchical Task Network Planning. The program corrects a given action sequence to form a valid HTN plan by deleting the minimal number of actions. As input it takes the model (domain and problem file) and a plan (plan file). If the plan is valid – (there exists a goal task that decomposes into the full plan) – it will inform the user. If the plan is invalid – (there is no such task) – the program removes the minimal number of actions from the plan in order to find a task that will decompose into this new subplan. The output of the program is then the list of actions that must be deleted and the goal task.  

In order to run the program simply put the domain problem and plan files in the same folder as the executable. They must be named "domain.lisp", "problem", "plan.txt" or give them as arguments to the program in this order: domain, problem, plan.
